<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/driver.js@1.0.0-next.0/dist/style.css"/>
```


## Start Using
Once installed, you can import the package in your project. The following example shows how to highlight an element:

```js
import Driver from "driver.js";
import "driver.js/dist/driver.css";

const driver = new Driver();
driver.highlight({
  element: "#some-element",
  popover: {
    title: "Title",
    description: "Description"
  }
});
```
