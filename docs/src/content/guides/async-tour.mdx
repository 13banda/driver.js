You can also have async steps in your tour. This is useful when you want to load some data from the server and then show the tour.

<CodeSample

  tour={[
    {
      element: '.line:nth-child(11)',
      popover: {
        title: 'First Step',
        description: 'You can add a function to override the default behavior of the next button i.e. to fetch some data from the server and then call moveNext()',
      }
    },
    {
      element: '.line:nth-child(14)',
      popover: {
        title: 'Manually Handle Next',
        description: 'Here we are moving to the next step manually since driver.js does not know when the data is loaded from the server.',
      }
    },
    {
      popover: {
        title: 'Next Step is Async',
        description: 'This is the first step. Next element will be loaded from the server.',
